# Buffer-Overflow-Attack

## Overview
This project involved learning how to implement a buffer overflow attack. 

## Technologies Used
- Python

## Key Features
- Overwriting return address
- NOP sled
- shellcode
- disassembly

## What You Learned
Learned how buffer overflow attacks work, how to disassemble functions, create a NOP sled, and redirect code to point to shellcode. 

## Note
